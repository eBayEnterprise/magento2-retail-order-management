// the extension - which includes the Behat integration tests, with an
// integration install of M2 and the extension - which will be the system being
// tested. This will also add the autoloader for the integration environment
// which will be prepended to the registered autoloaders causing resources in
// the integration environment to be preferred over resources in the dev
// environment. Only resources that do not exist in the integration environment
// should be pulled from the dev environment.
// @TODO This is a potential problem as the dev environment could mask some
// holes that exist in the integration environment, e.g. something is missing
// from the integration environment but in the dev environment so covers up
// a failure.
